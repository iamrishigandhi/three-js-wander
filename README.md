# Three.js Wander Behavior Demo

This repository showcases a simple implementation of wander behavior using Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for 3D graphics. The wander behavior simulates a wandering motion, creating a natural and random movement for an object in a 3D space.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamrishigandhi/threejs-wander.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd threejs-wander
   ```

3. Install the dependencies (inside your folder with the repository):

   ```bash
   npm install --save three

   npm install --save-dev vite

   npx vite
   ```
## Usage

1. Start the development server, by going to the link provided after running `npx vite`

2. It most probably will lead to something like `http://localhost:5173`.

3. Explore the wander behavior of the 3D object in the scene.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the code to suit your needs. You can adjust parameters like wander radius, speed, and other factors in the code. Check the `src/character.js` file for the implementation details.

## Contributing

If you have any improvements or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) community for providing a powerful 3D graphics library.

Enjoy exploring the wander behavior in Three.js!
